For this lab we will use *OpenShift Pipelines* based on Tekton. 
OpenShift provides a marketplace of installable software packaged as link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/[Kubernetes Operator] called https://operatorhub.io[OperatorHub] .
You can add Kubernetes-native CI/CD to your cluster installing OpenShift Pipelines directly from OperatorHub embedded marketplace inside OpenShift.
